- Document everything!
- Handle all items marked with "`TODO`" or "`###`" in the code
- Double-check DO's official term for API keys/tokens
- Bring the code in line with PEP 8 and pylint
- Replace `minibin/*` with unit tests that just invoke the command-line client

# Command-Line Interface

- Add error handling
- `doapi-droplet`: Rename the `upgrades` and `snapshots` commands so as to
  eliminate confusion with `upgrade` and `snapshot`
- Use docopt instead of argparse?
- Add `--wait` options to `doapi-floating-ip`'s actions

# Library

- Give Image a `wait` method
- Look into whether one can fetch all of a floating IP's actions via
  `/v2/floating_ips/$ADDR/actions`; if so, give FloatingIP `fetch_all_actions`,
  `fetch_last_action`, and `wait` methods (and give the CLI floating
  IP-specific action commands)
- Add an `Actionable` class encapsulating all of Droplet, Image, and
  FloatingIP's shared action behavior
- Add support for floating IPs to `Action.fetch_resource`
- Give `doapi` `account`, `kernel`, etc. methods?
- Should the `fetch_all_*` methods return generators instead of lists?
- Add a class for droplets' `next_backup_window` fields
- Look into the correctness of the na√Øve implementation of `fetch_last_action`
- Prevent classes without IDs from being initialized with an int
- If an error occurs inside `_wait`, it should return the remaining objects
  somehow (by yielding them? by attaching them to the exception?) before
  letting it propagate out
- DOAPIError should take as attributes the fields of the JSON object returned
  in the body (if any)

- Try to be more consistent regarding when deep copies of objects are created.
    - Passing an image, region, etc. object to `Droplet` (e.g., when copying a
      droplet) causes it to be deep-copied.
    - The droplet reference passed to a network, kernel, backup, or snapshot
      object is not deep-copied.

- Fix `JSObject.__repr__`'s handling of meta attributes
    - Show `doapi_manager` and DomainRecord's `domain`
        - Should `doapi_manager` be omitted from nested objects?
    - Do not show `_meta_attrs` (which isn't supposed to be in `vars()` anyway)
      or Network's `ip_version`
    - Do not show `droplet` when recursing inside a droplet
        - Only show `droplet` as an int?
- Rethink giving `doapi` a `__repr__` method (Showing the API key is bad,
  right?)

- Make JSObject into a Mapping/MutableMapping that skips "meta" attributes,
  eliminating the need for `_asdict`
    - Attributes are divided into two groups, "API" (which are preserved when
      converted to JSON and show up in iteration) and "meta" (which are not).
      `foo.x` fetches a meta attribute if it exists, an API attribute
      otherwise.  `foo['x']` always fetches an API attribute.  `foo.x = y`
      always(?) sets a meta attribute; to set an API attribute, do `foo['x'] =
      y`.
    - API attributes are stored in a private dict meta attribute

    - cf. UserDict

## Naming things

- Look into more appropriate/standard names for `_asdict`
- Rename `action.done` to `action.ended`?
- Should the `url` methods be renamed to avoid confusion with droplet upgrades'
  "url" fields?
- Rename the `doapi` class to `Manager`?
- Should the `Network` class be renamed `Interface` or something like that?
