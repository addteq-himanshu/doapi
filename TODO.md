# For Version 1

- Document everything!
    - Write a README
    - Document the basic attributes of all resource classes (`.fields`,
      `.doapi_manager`, use as a dict, conversion to a dict, etc.)
    - Add a docstring to `__init__.py` for displaying in pydoc
- Get `doapi CMD --help` to have the same output as `doapi-CMD --help`
    - Also unbreak `doapi account --rate-limit` and `doapi request`
- When `--multiple` is in effect, should image slugs that are also names of
  available images be interpreted as both? (and likewise for SSH keys &
  fingerprints?)
    - What about IDs that are also valid names for droplets/images/SSH keys?
      Are such names even allowed?
- Is it actually possible to unset a DNS record's port/priority/weight by
  "updating" it to `null`?

## Naming Things

- Look into BCP for naming of API "manager" objects like `doapi`
    - Rename to `Manager`?  `DOAPIClient`?  `DOClient`?
    - Rename `doapi_manager` to just `manager`?
- Rename `doapi.create_droplets` to `doapi.create_multiple_droplets`?
- Rename `fetch_current_action` to `fetch_in_progress_action`?
- Come up with a better name for `--multiple`?

# General

- Convert these items into GitHub issues
- Documentation:
    - Better organize the methods & properties of each class (Alphabetize them?)
    - Keep Sphinx from turning `:var:`s into hyperlinks
    - Show inheritance trees for DOEncoder and DOAPIError?
    - Try to improve the layout of subcommand documentation
    - Add index entries for commands
    - Add a separate section to the documentation for private/internal methods
      & classes
        - Document `__init__` methods
    - Convert the CLI documentation to manpages?
    - Add the CLI documentation to each command's source file as a docstring?
    - Improve the appearance of the "APIDocs" citations in the documentation
- Add tests
    - Test giving non-ASCII names to things in both Python 2 and Python 3

# Command-Line Interface

- Use argh instead of argparse (or at least do _something_ to clean up the
  argument-processing code)
- Add checks to mutating commands to ensure that the same object isn't listed
  on the command line twice
- Handle fetching actions of objects that are being deleted
- `doapi-droplet new`:
    - If an error occurs in the middle of creating droplets (e.g., if the
      user's droplet limit is exceeded), print out the droplets that have been
      created so far
    - Improve the template for autogenerated SSH key names
- `doapi-image show`: Forbid using `--multiple` with `--type`, `--private`,
  etc.
- `doapi-request`: When an error response is returned, should the response body
  still be output? (instead of or in addition to the traceback?)

# Library

- If an error occurs inside `_wait`, it should return the remaining objects
  somehow (by yielding them? by attaching them to the exception?) before
  letting the error propagate out
- Eliminate duplication of type-conversion code in initializers

# API Compatibility & Correctness

- A lot of the code relies on the assumptions that an object cannot have more
  than one in-progress action running on it at a time and that, if there is an
  in-progress action, it the most recent and the first listed.  Confirm this.
    - Creating a floating IP assigned to a droplet produces two actions (create
      & assign) that (always?) have the same start time and can be listed with
      the 'assign' (which completes later and has a greater ID) coming after
      the 'create'.
- [For the CLI] Confirm the assumption that private images are the only kind of
  images that can be acted on
- Look into the correctness of the na√Øve implementation of `fetch_last_action`
- Look into whether fetching an action via `/v2/actions/$ACTION_ID` is always
  equivalent to fetching via
  `/v2/$RESOURCE_TYPE/$RESOURCE_ID/actions/$ACTION_ID`
- Look into whether DO accepts public keys with options and, if so, update
  `doapi-droplet new` to parse them correctly
- Confirm whether extant actionable resources always have at least one action
  in their history
