- Support tagging: <https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/v2/#tags>
    - Add a (public) method for constructing a `Tag` object without fetching
      anything?
- Support block storage
- Test creating an SSH key containing non-ASCII UTF-8
    - Also test creating a droplet with non-ASCII UTF-8 user data

- It seems that Exceptions make their error message available via a(n
  undocumented?) `message` property, which conflicts with the "message" field
  that DOAPIError's constructor tries to assign.  Deal with this.

# For Version 1

- Document everything!
    - Document the basic attributes of all resource classes (`.fields`,
      `.doapi_manager`, use as a dict, dict methods, conversion to a dict,
      `__eq__`, etc.)
    - Add a docstring to `__init__.py` for displaying in pydoc
    - Add more examples
        - Add examples of using the `act` subcommand
    - Add usage examples to README
    - Add a summary (based on the README) to `index.rst`
    - Add a note about the pitfalls of running `doapi-droplet rebuild <drop>`
      (no `--image`) when the droplet's base image is no longer available
    - Add a "quick start" section for both the library and CLI
    - Add a "quick start" section to the README
- Is it actually possible to unset a DNS record's port/priority/weight by
  "updating" it to `null`?
- Should `--unique` also prevent names that conflict with slugs, IDs, and/or
  fingerprints?
- Rethink whether `wait` subcommands should completely ignore arguments that
  don't have any in-progress actions on them

- Keep rethinking data structures
    - Replace methodless classes (BackupWindow, Kernel?, Networks,
      NetworkInterface?, Region?, Size?) with unsubclassed `Resource` (or
      `Property`?) instances?

## Naming Things

- Rename `doapi_manager` to just `manager`? (something else?)
- Come up with a better name for `--multiple`? (`--match-all`? `--many`?)
- Rename `doapi.wait_actions_on_objects`?

# General

- Convert these items into GitHub issues
- Documentation:
    - Better organize the methods & properties of each class (Alphabetize them?)
    - Keep Sphinx from turning `:var:`s into hyperlinks
    - Try to improve the layout of subcommand documentation
    - Add index entries for commands
    - Add a separate section to the documentation for private/internal methods
      & classes
        - Document `__init__` methods
    - Convert the CLI documentation to manpages?
    - Add the CLI documentation to each command's source file as a docstring?
    - Improve the appearance of the "APIDocs" citations in the documentation
    - Give every applicable item a link to the corresponding entry in the API
      docs
    - Incorporate the changelog
    - Mention somewhere that the API doesn't have a way to retrieve regions or
      sizes by slug (or droplets/images/SSH keys by name), so if you want that,
      you have to retrieve & filter all of them
- Add tests
    - Test giving non-ASCII names to things in both Python 2 and Python 3

# Command-Line Interface

- Use argh (or cmdpy?) instead of argparse (or at least do _something_ to clean
  up the argument-processing code)
- Handle fetching actions of objects that are being deleted
- `doapi-droplet new`:
    - If an error occurs in the middle of creating droplets (e.g., if the
      user's droplet limit is exceeded), print out the droplets that have been
      created so far
    - Improve the template for autogenerated SSH key names
    - Specifying both `--unique` and the same name multiple times should, at
      the very least, produce a warning
- `doapi-image show`: Forbid using `--multiple` with `--type`, `--private`,
  etc.
- `doapi-image show`: Allow using `--private` with `--type` and its shortcuts
- `doapi-request`: When an error response is returned, should the response body
  still be output? (instead of or in addition to the traceback?)
- Support snapshotting multiple droplets at once without having to use a tag
- Support passing arbitrary extra arguments to `new` commands
- Refactor the code for fetching resources specified on the command line
- Be case-insensitive when looking up SSH keys by fingerprint
- When `--multiple` is in effect, prevent an object whose ID/slug/fingerprint
  is also its name from being matched (and then pruned with a warning) more
  than once
- When an error message suggests using `--multiple`, *all* objects that would
  be matched (not just the ones with matching names) should be listed
- Improve the help text for `--multiple` (especially for action commands)
- Rewrite the Cache methods so that their return types are fixed rather than
  determined by their arguments
- Allow placing the universal options after subcommands
- How should `doapi-droplet snapshot --unique` act when given multiple droplets
  to snapshot?

# Library

- If an error occurs inside `_wait`, it should return the remaining objects
  somehow (by yielding them? by attaching them to the exception?) before
  letting the error propagate out
- Eliminate duplication of type-conversion code in initializers
- Should all casts to `str` use `unicode` instead?
- Handle (i.e., add an exception for) the API returning invalid JSON?

# API Compatibility & Correctness

- A lot of the code relies on the assumptions that an object cannot have more
  than one in-progress action running on it at a time and that, if there is an
  in-progress action, it the most recent and the first listed.  Confirm this.
    - Creating a floating IP assigned to a droplet produces two actions (create
      & assign) that (always?) have the same start time and can be listed with
      the 'assign' (which completes later and has a greater ID) coming after
      the 'create'.
- [For the CLI] Confirm the assumption that private images are the only kind of
  images that can be acted on
- Look into the correctness of the na√Øve implementation of `fetch_last_action`
- Look into whether fetching an action via `/v2/actions/$ACTION_ID` is always
  equivalent to fetching via
  `/v2/$RESOURCE_TYPE/$RESOURCE_ID/actions/$ACTION_ID`
- Look into whether DO accepts public keys with options and, if so, update
  `doapi-droplet new` to parse them correctly
- It appears that now, if you try to delete an assigned floating IP, a 202
  response with a single space in the body (declared as text/html!) is
  returned, and the IP is unassigned but remains.  Sending a DELETE request
  again deletes the IP normally.  Handle this.
- The pagination code assumes that the `per_page` parameter is preserved in
  links.  Confirm this.
